### Managing user groups.
## Minimum required values: 'name' and 'state'
##
## For better maintainability, the group list is built during runtime by
## combining all lists together. This will provide the freedom of declaring
## custom group lists for granular control. The lists require a naming
## convention by using a pattern. The pattern is rendered as a single list
## which can be used for iteration with variable: 'role_localusers_group_list'
## The list name pattern needs to start with: 'role_localusers_group_list_'

## Example of a list for default inheritance:
# role_localusers_group_list_default:
#   - name: group1
#     state: present
#   - name: group2
#     state: absent
